      <p> These are statements taken from people’s conversations during Diplomacy games played online. Diplomacy is a game about pre-World War 1 Europe. It usually has seven players: England, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Turkey.</p>
      <p> In these statements, players try to form alliances to plan military campaigns and defeat each other, but things might change quickly.</p>
      <p>Each statement is a piece of a dialogue from a SENDER player to a RECEIVER player.</p>
      <p>Please classify the statements according to whether the sender is talking about game moves, other players, reasoning out a move, or trying to build a rapport with the receiver.</p>
      <p> Select "YES" if you're really confident about your answer. A single statement can have a "YES" for more than one question. </p>
<p>Underlined words suggest what to look out for, but there will be other signals too.</p>
