Let's keep it between you and me!
I like to coordinate, but on these sort of 50/50 guesses, I kind of like to keep it secret so that if it doesnâ€™t go well, I have nobody to blame but myself.
Hmmmm, okay. Well, letâ€™s just keep that between you and me then.
Okay, so I still have a teensy little bone to pick with you: on the off-chance that Austria wasn't lying and you *did* take Trieste unexpectedly, I sort of worry that I might be next.
I have some thoughts on the matter, and some information, but I'd like to feel confident that you and I will keep anything we say between us.
But in the interest of continued full disclosure, here's what I think
So I'm in sort of a conflicted spot
